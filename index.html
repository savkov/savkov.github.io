Thank you for browsing by. My name is Sasho (<i>Ð¡Ð°ÑˆÐ¾</i> in Cyrillic and /<i>'saÊƒÉ”</i>/ in IPA). I am a manager in the AI field with a background in NLProc and Healthcare. My interests lie in conversation summarisation, evaluation of generative models, and more broadly any applications of NLProc in the clinical setting.

In my spare time I like to climb, hike and play video games. I'm not any good at either of them, but it's fun ðŸ˜‚
