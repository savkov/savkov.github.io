<p style="padding-top: 50px;">
Thanks for browsing by. My name is Sasho, written as <i>Ð¡Ð°ÑˆÐ¾</i> in Cyrillic or /<i>'saÊƒÉ”</i>/ in IPA. I'm a natural language processing specialist: part scientist, part engineer. I live with my <a href="http://misspumpkin.co.uk/">better half</a> usually somewhere in London and I work for one of the awesomest companies around -- <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/">Babylon</a>.
</p>
<p>
My professional interests are mainly in entity and relation extraction, clinical text and dialogue, distributional semantics (broadly), semantic graphs and text summarisation. If you want to contact me, email <a href="mailto:me@sasho.io">me@sasho.io</a>; if you want to meet me, I'm usually at the PyData London or South England NLP meetups.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I like to climb, hike and play video games. I'm not any good at either of them, but it's fun ðŸ˜‚
