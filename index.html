Thanks for browsing by. My name is Sasho. I'm a natural language processing specialist: part scientist, part engineer. I live with my [better half](http://misspumpkin.co.uk/) usually somewhere in London and I work for one of the awesomest companies around -- [Babylon](https://www.babylonhealth.com/).

My professional interests are mainly in entity and relation extraction, clinical text and dialogue, distributional semantics (broadly), semantics and text summarisation. If you want to contact me, email me at [me@sasho.io](mailto:me@sasho.io); if you want to meet me, I'm usually at the PyData London or South England NLP meetups.


In my spare time I like to climb, hike and play video games. I'm not any good at either of them, but it's fun ðŸ˜‚
