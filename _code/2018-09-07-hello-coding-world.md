Someone I know calls himself a Google developer because he writes code by googling. He says, everyone does this these days and he's right. 
It's one of the great things about the Internet as long as we don't forget that every now and then we should give back to the community.
So this is what this is -- me giving back to the Internet. Explaining small technical challenges that I solve.
